            2019 –Present
          </p>
          <p>Store / Inventory Manager | Apr 2020 – Present</p>
          <p>
            Successfully took stock of, and neatly arranged, over 4000 different
            products in each of the company’s 9 stores in the period of 3
            months. Worked alongside my assistant on this project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Introduced a method to easily identify items in each of the 9 stores
            with the use of the “CLOCK notations”. This reduced the time it took
            to identify products in the stores by at least 70%.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developed an inventory management system that placed products in the
            9 stores by categories. This created more space in the stores and
            allowed for easy access to products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maintain over 90% accuracy in product knowledge in a high-volume
            retail store consisting of over 4000 different products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oversee activities of 4 Sales Representatives and supervise daily
            store operations such as stock-taking, inventory management, and
            end-of-day financial reporting.
